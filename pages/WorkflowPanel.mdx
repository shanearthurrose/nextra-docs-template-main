> **What is a Workflow Panel?**
>
> A Workflow Panel is a customisable dashboard element that displays information,such as a count of open Work Orders, or outstanding paperwork. The statistic displayed can be clicked to take you to the relevant list. The intention behind this is
to provide an easy way for Users to identify tasks to be completed, or to keep an eye on attendance deadlines, for example.
You can have more than one panel of each type, with each displaying results for a different context.
The panels available to you depends on your Role within the system. Workflow panels are displayed on a Workflow view, available via the ‘Workflow’ link at the top of the Navigation Panel.


>
> **What is meant by ‘Context’**
>
> The statistics displayed by a panel can be restricted to certain criteria, such as the contracts and sites you are assigned to, or by your Parent, if you are a Client user. Selecting a context allows you to have a panel focusing on a subset of results
