# 1. WHY DO YOU NEED AN AUTHENTICATOR APP?

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
 This section describes why you need an Authenticator App.
</Callout>


## 1.1. What is MFA?
Multi-factor Authentication, or MFA, refers to the practice of confirming multiple authentication factors
when a user logs in to a system. This usually takes the form of a password (like you currently use), then a
one-time password provided by an authenticator app.

## 1.2. Why do we need MFA?
While important, usernames and passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be stolen by third
parties. Enforcing the use of an MFA factor like a one-time password means increased confidence that CBC
and the personal and client information we store, including your own, will stay safe from cyber criminals.

## 1.3. How will MFA work with CMMS?
From July 1, 2022, MFA will become a hard requirement when logging in. You will be prompted for your
username and password as normal, then prompted with an MFA enrolment page. You will need to link an
authenticator app, and then moving forwards, this authenticator app will provide a code that will need to be
entered during the login process. Instructions for how to setup and use an Authenticator App will be
provided in the coming weeks. Links to available Authenticator Apps are provided below.

## 1.4. A note on sharing Accounts
Sharing accounts is not permitted under the CMMS Terms of Use, and will of course be a complication when
setting up an Authenticator app. If you are sharing an account, prior to the MFA start date, please reach out
to CMMS Support (cmmssupport@cbcgroup.com.au) so we can set up additional accounts so that each user
can link their own authenticator app to their CMMS account.

## 2.1. Possible Apps
There are many Authenticator Apps available across android and iOS (Apple) devices. Some of the more
popular ones are noted below, although there are many others as well. You may already have one installed.
We recommend having one downloaded and ready, to avoid disruption on the day MFA is activated.
