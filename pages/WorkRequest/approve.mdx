> **INFO:_** Work Requests represent a request for CBC to engage a technician to perform work. Work Requests are often raised in response to a fault on a piece of equipment / asset maintained by CBC. Only when a Work Request is approved by the Client and converted to a Work Order by CBC will a technician be despatched to address the request.
