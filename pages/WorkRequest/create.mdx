> Work Requests represent a request for CBC to engage a technician to perform work. Work Requests are often raised in response to a fault on a piece of equipment / asset maintained by CBC. Only when a Work Request is approved by the Client and converted to a Work
Order by CBC will a technician be despatched to address the request. Users who can raise a Work Request are governed by Contract Settings, and your role. If you are not assigned to a Contract that allows you to raise a Work Request, you may find that certain functions will not be available to you.



> NOTE
>
> CBC Facilities Management reserves the right to decline or propose edits for Work Requests after Client Approval should the work be outside the scope of any contracts that may exist, or beyond the capabilities of CBC.


## 1. Raise a Work Request from the Navigation Panel

1. Click the ‘Work Requests’ menu option on the Navigation Panel, followed by the ‘Raise New’ option, to launch the Work Request Wizard.


2. Complete the ‘Details’ section.

* First, select a Contract. This will load relevant Site and Asset information, as well as display other fields that may be required to be completed. If no contracts appear, you may not have the necessary permissions to raise a Work Request.
* Complete other fields as required. Note that some fields are mandatory, as indicated by the red asterisk.
* Status – Select the initial Status of the Work Request. The options available are governed by permissions and for most users, the Status field will be locked to ‘Awaiting Client Approval’. Managers can provide approval at the time of raising the Work Request by
selecting the ‘Approved for Action’ status.

NOTE
> Until a Work Request is approved by the Client, Work Requests are not converted to Work Orders and therefore CBC will engage a technician to undertake work.
> Approvers of Work Requests can see a list of Work Requests awaiting approval via your Workflow Panel settings on your user profile.
