## Freshdesk


Freshdesk is an online service ticket management system. It allows users to lodge a ticket, which represents an issue or request, which can be assigned to an agent who will action the request. All tickets are date stamped and tracked, and allow for management of due dates and comments.

Freshdesk also allows for the management of a Knowledge Base, a repository of categorised articles or documents. Help documentation is stored here and made accessible to all users.

This service will be utilised to manage issues with the new system.
